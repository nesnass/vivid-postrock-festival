    <p>Ingrid Kristensen Bjørnaali (1991) from Kristiansand, works and lives in Oslo. 
      She mainly works with video art and wood cut, and recently finished her bachelor in medium- and material based art at the Oslo National Academy of the Arts.

    </h2>
    <p>-&gt; for TRNA</p>
    <p>Waverant is the ongoing visual arts project of UK based artist Alex Dickson. Having worked closely with various bands and musicians across Europe and beyond; Alex delivers striking visual work that often depicts natural scenes that are twisted and contorted many times over; almost to the point at which they become indistinguishable from their original form. He achieves this through a combination of repetition and duplication and also via an amalgamation of analogue and digital signal processing that allows for new visual forms to take hold. His previous work includes collaborations with bands such as Kokomo, Watered and Sleepmakeswaves and electronic artists Gagarin, Nolan Dialta and Daniel Adam. He is also one half of Brighton based ambient/drone/noise outfit, Benen.

    </h2>
    <p>-&gt; for Mantis</p>
    <p>SuperviewTV is a Belgian VJ duo focusing mainly on interactive video and live visual integration.
      They specialise in old school video manipulation through glitching, feedback and other fx.
      In bigger projects, live camera feeds are merged with clips and often modulated by audio, 
      creating direct communication between the artist and the audiance.
      Since 2015, SuperviewTV have been challenging themselves by providing visuals for live bands such 
      as Mantis, where they try to translate the song structures into a video reproductive setting.
