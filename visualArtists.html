    <p>We always used nature videos at our shows and only recently decided to collaborate with the VJ, who in real time creates video abstractions on the screen. His name is Mikael Bayrikyan. He performed at Mujuice, Philip Gorbachev, Nikita Zabelin and many other shows, and also created videos for the project Fountain. In addition, Mikael plays audiovisual live under the nickname Synchronome (aka BSNVT) and managed to show up at the last Error_404 (techno festival), as well as at the international festival of electronic music "Electro Mechanica".  
    </p>
    <p>
        At the VIVID festival we will present a video in which abstractions and nature will be combined.

        <a href="http://www.jakobberglund.com/vivid/" target="none">A Swarm of the Sun</a> [SE]
    </h2>
    <p>A Swarm of the Sun has always treated the visual part of their albums with the same dignity as the music itself. It's also something they've consistently created themselves. Jakob Berglund has art directed all albums, as well as produced video, photography and designed and developed for web and digital platforms. So it should come as no surprise that the band keeps this tight creative control when they bring their vision to the stage. Jakob seeks to create abstract and intense imagery - where uncanny and raw emotion is hidden in the cracks of stillness. It's an expansion of "The Woods" - the band's latest album - but also something new.  
    </p>
    <p>
        At VIVID, A Swarm of the Sun is teaming up with graphical designer and VJ Peter Wallentin, who will mix and manipulate Jakob's visuals throughout the set. He is currently based in Stockholm, but has a been an active VJ in the Malmö club scene.

    </h2>
    <p>-&gt; for TRNA</p>
    <p>Waverant is the ongoing visual arts project of UK based artist Alex Dickson. Having worked closely with various bands and musicians across Europe and beyond; Alex delivers striking visual work that often depicts natural scenes that are twisted and contorted many times over; almost to the point at which they become indistinguishable from their original form. He achieves this through a combination of repetition and duplication and also via an amalgamation of analogue and digital signal processing that allows for new visual forms to take hold. His previous work includes collaborations with bands such as Kokomo, Watered and Sleepmakeswaves and electronic artists Gagarin, Nolan Dialta and Daniel Adam. He is also one half of Brighton based ambient/drone/noise outfit, Benen.

    </h2>
    <p>-&gt; for Mantis</p>
    <p>SuperviewTV is a Belgian VJ duo focusing mainly on interactive video and live visual integration.
      They specialise in old school video manipulation through glitching, feedback and other fx.
      In bigger projects, live camera feeds are merged with clips and often modulated by audio, 
      creating direct communication between the artist and the audiance.
      Since 2015, SuperviewTV have been challenging themselves by providing visuals for live bands such 
      as Mantis, where they try to translate the song structures into a video reproductive setting.
