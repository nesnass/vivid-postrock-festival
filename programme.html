      </h2>
      <p>Hailing from the city of Rostov-on-Don in the South-West of Russia, 417.3 is a band that could easily fool anyone into believing they have nothing to say, considering that both their name and the track titles consists of nothing but seemingly random numbers and symbols, but once the music starts you quickly realize that they're speaking a completely different language that paints a beautiful picture, and we're very happy bringing these maestros to Norway to evoke all kinds of imageries!
      </p>
      <p>It's been two years since 417.3 released their album "34", meaning they're now hard at work writing the material for an upcoming release, some tracks of which we are very likely to hear the live premieres of, accompanied by stunning visuals, when this band makes the trek all the way to the southernmost city of Norway for the first time ever.

      <p><strong>Aiming for Enrike</strong> – A tour de force to be reckoned with. This Oslo-based duo have, since the release of their sophomore album, Las Napalmas, been making huge waves, upon which they've surfed not only throughout Europe but also all the way to the land of the Rising Sun; Japan, a wave that will also take them across the Atlantic Ocean this Autumn! But before all that, they'll swing by VIVID, bringing old and new music alike.
      </p>
      <p>This unholy chimera that sounds like a mix of <strong>And So I Watch You From Afar</strong> and <strong>Fuck Buttons</strong> are currently releasing new tracks every month, all of which will be compiled into a full album, Music For Workouts, at the end of the year, and we can't think of a better venue to showcase them than at Aladdin Scene!

      </h2>
      <p>It is an absolute no brainer that And So I Watch You From Afar has the most relatable content for an average post-rock listener than most other bands out there. Their style touches upon everything that everyone loves about the genre and yet add a dab of unique magical content that sets them apart from any other band in the world. Their musical concoction involves skipping the oh-so-famed lengthy and brooding buildups commonly associated with most post-rock music, jump directly with crescendos and take the high road from there. The band has aged really well, with every subsequent album being progressively catchier and groovier than ever before yet maintaining the intensely cathartic songwriting abilities that each member strongly possess. Be it the seizure-inducing riffs of ‘Heirs’ or the laid back grooves of their self titled album, And So I Watch You From Afar have always proved to be a bunch of extremely dynamic folks who blur the lines between cacophony and grandiosity with bravado.
      </p>
      <p>And So I Watch You From Afar completes their 10-year anniversary this year and will be celebrating this amazing achievement in this year’s VIVID, and we couldn’t have imagined a better setting than the picturesque Kristiansand for this!

      <h2>
          <a href="https://www.aswarmofthesun.com/" target="none">A Swarm of the Sun</a> [SE]
      </h2>
      <p>For a band that has been around for well over a decade, it is kinda surprising, and equally exciting, that 2019 is the year they decided to bring it to the live stage for the first time, with the release of their critically acclaimed new album, The Woods. Although being primarily a duo, A Swarm of the Sun from Stockholm have gathered up some highly skilled musicians to form a sextet in order to bring the excellence of their sound to life in a live setting
      </p>
      <p>In order to give you an idea of exactly how great The Woods is, here are a few excerpts from a couple of reviews:</p>
      <p>"Truth be told, I don’t think you could have asked for a better follow-up to The Rifts than this album. For while it may not quite reach the same stratospheric heights, or plumb the same emotionally devastating depths, as its predecessor, it still offers an experience that’s practically just as captivating and compelling in its own right." – <a href="https://www.nocleansinging.com/2019/01/02/a-swarm-of-the-sun-the-woods/" target="none">No Clean Singing</a>
      </p>
      <p>"It seems that A Swarm of the Sun thrive best in misery then. They’ve released three tracks here that each explore the darkest depths of the human experience, and do so in a beautiful way. It’s perhaps not a mire one should stay in for very long – at times the darkness can feel a bit too overbearing, for both the listener and the band – but it’s a mire than anyone who appreciates longer, morose soundscapes should happily wallow in." – <a href="https://www.echoesanddust.com/2019/01/a-swarm-of-the-sun-the-woods/" target="none">Echoes and Dust</a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Simply put, missing out on this would be a huge mistake, especially on the VIVID stage where the audiovisual experience will bring their music to its full potential!

      </h2>
      <p>While black metal is anything but unusual in Norway, having been a hotspot for the genre for the past three decades and arguably even the birthplace of it, the Stavanger-based quartet Avast has some pretty big shoes to fill – So they did! By mixing the best elements of black metal and post-metal, they've created a hybrid that is every bit as ferocious and heavy as it is beautiful, and they will be a great asset to the line-up this year!
      </p>
      <p>In October last year, Avast released their debut album "Mother Culture", which ended up becoming critically acclaimed, with <a href="https://www.nocleansinging.com/2018/09/03/shades-of-black-part-2-yovel-eternal-sacrifice-avast-huldrekall-spektral-hatchery-s-e-k-h/" target="none">No Clean Singing</a> describing it with these sentences: "It unabashedly pulls at the heartstrings, and does so with such skill that if you’re in the right kind of mood (or the wrong one), you might find a muffled sob in your throat one minute — and your head back and hands lifted to the skies the next, carried away by the majestic glory of what you’re hearing. The closing minutes, in particular, are simply wonderful."

      <p>Doomjazz? Deathjazz? Darkjazz? All of the above? This trio from Kristiansand recently released their eponymous debut album, much to the delight of people from all across the board, be it metalheads or jazz aficionados.
      </p>
      <p>This will be the first time a band from Kristiansand perform at our festival, even though this is actually our second encounter with Dualistic, them having played an intimate "VIVID Presents" set at Vaktbua last year!
      </p>
      <p>"With this newest trio, featuring Fredriok Sahlander on bass and Tobias Øymo Solbakk on drums, Moen combines his love for both, harder music and jazz improvisation, with a keen ear for where the two may meet. Contrary to what one might expect from the sound of that, the constant changes of rhythm, dynamics and mood have an uplifting and exciting effect and refrain from dwelling in all too dark places. Not an easy listen, but a fun one!" - <a href="https://www.allaboutjazz.com/losen-records-in-for-a-strong-2019-by-friedrich-kunzmann.php" target="none">All About Jazz</a></p>
      <p>"This album is not going to appeal to most jazz fans. It lies at the furthest edges of what’s achievable with a hyphen. But jazz-metal, at least here, is tremendous fun, and worth a try." - <a href="http://www.londonjazznews.com/2019/05/cd-review-dualistic-dualistic.html" target="none">London Jazz News</a></p>

      <p>While their name, indignu, is Latin for "unworthy", we feel like they're not only more than worthy but also, in fact, a gift that keeps on giving. For the first time in Scandinavia, this Portuguese collective will bring music so emotive and evocative that not a single eye at Aladdin Scene will be dry when their set is over.
      </p>
      <p>Drawing inspiration from the tragic wildfires that took place in Portugal in recent years, indignu released their neoclassical epos, "umbra", last year. An album that is every bit as melancholic as it is incredibly uplifting and hopeful, and as such they'll be a great addition to VIVID! In the end, the question isn't if they're worthy or not, because they are. The question is; are we worthy? Remember to bring your handkerchief!

      </h2>
      <p>Having been around for close to fifteen years, the Münster-based progressive post-metal outfit, Long Distance Calling, has made their way to the top of the genre, and this will be their first visit to Northern Scandinavia, which of course is something we couldn't be more excited about!
      </p>
      <p>Long Distance Calling released their 6th studio album, "Boundless", last year, on which they returned to their instrumental roots, while at the same time bringing something new to the table, or as <a href="https://www.progradar.org/index.php/2018/02/13/review-long-distance-calling-boundless-by-kevin-thompson/" target="none">Progradar</a> put it: "So have Long Distance Calling pulled off the challenge of reinvention? For me it’s another resounding yes, to be shouted from the highest mountain and to echo in every valley. Their bravery has been rewarded and so shall yours if you have belief and buy the album."</p>
      <p>"Bands are criticised for drifting from their comfort zones at times or relying on tried and tested methods, this is no throwback but yet another push forward for Long Distance Calling whilst holding on to their distinctive sound, well done lads, keep up the good work."

      <p>While the Oslo-based quintet Monograf only just released their debut album, Nadir, they have in fact been around since the first half of the '10s. Combining the more melancholic side of Norwegian folk music with the aesthetics of post-rock, creating a sound that is every bit as gloomy as it is beautiful, with sparse vocals that sets a narrative that seemingly transcends time itself.
      </p>
      <p>Four years in the making, the release of Nadir marked the beginning of a new chapter in the Monograf timeline, featuring guest appearances from the VIVID. alumni Leonov, as well as hosting a variety of unconventional rock instruments, including a Mellotron, nyckelharpa (key harp), violins, and a Hammond organ.</p>

      <p>While there's a plethora of bands and artists that fit the general audiovisual concept of VIVID, few bands seem like they were essentially born and bred to be on our stage. Nordic Giants is one of those. This multi-instrumentalist duo from the UK takes the audiovisual concept to the next level, where they've chosen not only to include visuals as a backdrop and on stage but also to fully immerse themselves in it, resulting in an event that is every bit as beautiful as it is evocative.
      </p>
      <p>It will be their first time on stage here in Norway, and we can't think of a better venue for them to play on than the highly ephemeral stage of VIVID at Aladdin Scene. It's been over two years since they released the absolutely excellent album Amplify Human Vibration, after which they went into hibernation for a year, but now they're finally back!</p>

      </h2>
      <p>Seeing how it is the 5th anniversary of VIVID, we thought it would be fitting to bring one of the alumni from the very first edition back, namely The Seven Mile Journey from Denmark!
      </p>
      <p>While 2019 marks the 5th anniversary of VIVID, the Aalborg-based quartet are in fact celebrating their 20th anniversary this year, and they've started writing the material for a new release, some of which will be premiered at VIVID., which we obviously couldn't be more excited about!</p>
      <p>The Seven Mile Journey have mastered the art of storytelling without ever uttering a single word, conjuring up a highly evocative scenery using nothing but their instruments.</p>
