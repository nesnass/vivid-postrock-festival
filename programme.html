    <p>"A rhythmic noisy beast with something fresh at heart" - Norsk Jazzforum</p>
    <p>"the group came with a bubbling thunder roller of sound. Whirring, squealing and stomping it rode a kind of super disco making a mark." - All About Jazz</p>
    <p>"The theme of repetitive looped rhythms was echoed by excellent young band Drongo, who unlike their name, intelligently dissected polyrhythms
      between multiple guitars and keyboards, in a driving Kraut Rock-Afrobeat mashup." - Jazzwise Magazine</p>
    <p>"Sledgehammer rhythms led into a sharp cut to an a capella sea shanty episode, then the riffing resumed, with a shuffle-drumming thrust." - London Jazz News</p>
    <p>Drongo is a septet migrating somewhere between techno, kraut rock, and afrobeat.
      Centered around steady rhythms, improvisation and shifting minimalism, the music is constantly evolving, inviting the listener to progress with it.
    </p>
    <p>Growing out of the Kristiansand music scene, the members are involved with everything from improvised techno at Blå, live remixing Göteborgs Symfoniker, and playing noise rock in squats around Europe, to touring with some of the biggest norwegian names in metal and working as freelance musicians.
      They share an interest in exploring ways of playing together, experimenting with sound, aesthetics, and structure.

    </h2>
    <p>All Shall Be Well (and all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well), from Haarlem (the Netherlands), play instrumental, cinematic music. They build on themes, thresh out their melodies and look for unsuspected harmonies.
      Their music is highly associative; they liken their music to stories rather than songs.
    </p>
    <p>All Shall Be Well have taken their music on the road across many borders (including China, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Italy and Belgium).
      At live performances their image projections visualise their music, adding a deeper layer to their stories.
    </p>
    <p>After their debut record ROODBLAUW (2011), sophomore album BLAUWGEEL (2014), and the 2016 EP GEELZWART (on which they reimagined classical works by Beethoven, Grieg and Satie),
      the band is has released their third full length album ZWARTGROEN in February 2020.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>Kokomo is an instrumental rock band founded and grown up in the heyday of abandonment of vocals in “modern” rock music. We never frantically tried to reinvent the genre, but we hope we can set ourselves apart with new album and upcoming shows, reach people and evoke something in them.
      Then we have achieved all of our significant aims.
    </p>
    <p>Neglecting vocals is not a trend for us, it is conscious backpedalling. We want particularly to let the music speak for itself and think trough this to be able to say much more in the end.
    </p>
    <p>Right from the start our main focus was to have a good time, put a lot of love and effort in our music and everything related to it and play live as much as we can. Both on several tours we did and as support for acts like Caspian, God Is An Astronaut, Junius, A Silver Mt. Zion, This Will Destroy You, Maybeshewill and many more.
      One highlight must be the Germany tour with And So I Watch You From Afar.</p>
    <p>Since our formation in 2008 we have released a Demo (2008), a Split LP with Kasan (2010), a collaboration EP with Terraformer as Euryale (2014) and four studio LPs (Matterhorn Bob And The Black Fair 2009, If Wolves 2011, S/T 2013 & Monochrome Noise Love 2016).
      This year, we released our latest record Totem Youth via Dunk! Records, I.corrupt.Records and A Thousand Arms (US).</p>

      <p>Hailing from Oslo, Norway, Liongeist emerged from the melting pot that is Oslo's music scene in 2012.
      </p>
      <p>Liongeist have played extensively since 2013 and have gained notoriety throughout Norway for their visceral act and abundant atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Although the band’s roots are planted in post-hardcore, the group has always borrowed heavily from different genres. Blending influences from post-rock, post-metal,
        shoegaze and electronic music Liongeist now focus on creating instrumental music that is difficult to pin down to any specific style.</p>
      <p>Expect melancholic soundscapes ranging from brooding ambience, twinkling guitars, heavy walls of sound and soaring melodies.</p>

      <p>A five-piece post-metal outfit based in Boston, MA, Glacier is a band whose music fully embodies their name: a crushingly loud and unrelenting force.
      </p>
      <p>2019 saw the release of No Light Ever, their latest full-length record. Released on vinyl by Wolves & Vibrancy Records (Germany) and on CD by POST.
        Recordings (USA), No Light Ever is as bleak, brooding, and introspective as the name implies. With premieres and coverage in Decibel, CVLT Nation,
        Heavy Blog Is Heavy (and more), along with a nomination for 'Best Metal Artist' at the 2019 Boston Music Awards,
        No Light Ever has thrown Glacier into the spotlight in the burgeoning international post-metal/rock scene.
        Having landed on 'Best Of' year-end lists at Heavy Blog Is Heavy, WherePostRockDwells, Post Rock Discovery, Totoromoon, Diary of Doom, and Aural Fixation,
        No Light Ever has cemented Glacier as a force to be reckoned with heading into 2020.

      </h2>
      <p>In 2009, AMENRA released the beautiful and fragile EP Afterlife, meant as a musical testament for future generations.
        The acoustic tracks that made up this EP showed a very different aspect of the band, but also proved that in any incarnation AMENRA connects on a deeply emotional level with its audience.
      </p>
      <p>The acoustic album kept on lingering in the background, and it was only a matter of time for the band to revisit the acoustic approach of the EP.
      </p>
      <p>In 2014 AMENRA again showed their most vulnerable side on different stages.
        This album collects live recordings of old and new acoustic renditions of AMENRA tracks,
        but it also harbors the collaboration with Belgian poet Sofie Verdoodt and two bone chilling covers.
