<p>VIVID. a post_rock festival is an annual Post-Rock/ Post-Metal festival held on the south coast of Norway. The first edition was held in 2015, aiming to establish itself as a unique music festival emphasising audiovisual expressions, inclusion and hospitality. Vivid, "evocative, lifelike" describes not only our understanding of the post-rock genre - throughout the two days of the festival we want to expose post-rock to a new group of people, and to become a vivid cross-road for both artists and audience, musicians and visual artists. As part of the overall concept we will experiment with new ways of involving audience and audiovisual expressions. The event takes place in the old cinema in town, Aladdin, with its massive backdrop for visuals.</p>

<p>We are dependent on volunteer contributions from artists, organisers and friends alike. Throughout the two day festival there will be tea and food gatherings, and if we manage- workshops where international artists playing at the festival share some of their knowledge and experience. <strong>Want to join as a volunteer?</strong> You will get a free pass for the festival and meals on the day you contribute.
